This is a final project for CSC481 Image Processing.
This project is intended to locate the salient object of a given image
and compare that object to the salient object of another given image
to see if they are the same object. 


Object detection:
    I followed the guide found on this site:
    https://towardsdatascience.com/object-detection-with-10-lines-of-code-d6cb4d86f606

    This was a site for a custom AI library for image analysis:
    https://github.com/OlafenwaMoses/ImageAI/releases/download/2.0.2/imageai-2.0.2-py3-none-any.whl

    For ObjectDetector to work, you will need to download: resnet50_coco_best_v2.0.1.h5
    Place it in the 'Models' directory.


Saliency:
    There is a tutorial found on this site:
    https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/07/16/opencv-saliency-detection/


Feature extraction:
    I found a tutorial on this site:
